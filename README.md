PROJECT DESCRIPTION :
Neural Style Transfer (NST) is a deep learning technique that blends two images—a content image and a style image—to generate a new image that preserves the structure of the content image while adopting the artistic features of the style image. This project focuses on implementing NST using TensorFlow and a pre-trained model from TensorFlow Hub. The model, developed by Google Magenta, allows arbitrary style transfer, meaning it can apply any artistic style to any content image. The process involves loading and preprocessing both images by resizing them to 256x256 pixels and normalizing their pixel values. These images are then converted into tensors that can be processed by the model. The model generates a stylized output by analyzing the high-level content representation of the content image and the stylistic patterns of the style image. This output is then post-processed, converted into a standard image format, and saved locally. The project can be extended with a user interface using Streamlit to allow interactive uploads and downloads, making the experience more accessible to non-technical users. The applications of neural style transfer are wide-ranging. In the field of art and design, it enables artists and creators to generate new visuals by combining photography with famous painting styles. In photography and social media, it can be used to apply artistic filters to images for unique aesthetics. In entertainment and gaming, it helps developers create stylized assets or backgrounds that enhance storytelling and visual appeal. Despite its advantages, there are some limitations to consider. Stylization at low resolutions may cause loss of detail, and not all style-content combinations yield visually pleasing results. Additionally, the model is optimized for performance rather than high-resolution output, which might not be suitable for professional printing. Nevertheless, NST represents a creative use of artificial intelligence, demonstrating how neural networks can go beyond recognition tasks and contribute to artistic expression. It is an excellent example of how machine learning can support and enhance human creativity. This project not only serves as a technical exercise in deep learning and image processing but also as a bridge between technology and art, opening the door for future innovations in AI-generated media.
